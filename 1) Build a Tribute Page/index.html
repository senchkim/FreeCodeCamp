      <div id="img-caption">The merit of Marx is that he suddenly produces a qualitative change in the history of
        social thought.
        He interprets history, understands its dynamic, predicts the future, but in addition to predicting it (which
        would
        satisfy his
        scientific obligation), he expresses a revolutionary concept: the world must not only be interpreted, it must be
        transformed.
        Man ceases to be the slave and tool of his environment and converts himself into the architect of his own
        destiny.

      <h2 class="tribute-info-title">Biography</h2>
      <div class="tribute-text">
        Ernesto "Che" Guevara was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader,
        diplomat and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a
        ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.

      <div class="tribute-cite">
        The discovery of Che's remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations—rebel, martyr, rogue
        figure from a picaresque adventure, savior, renegade,
        extremist—in which there was no fixed divide among them. The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum
        that
        teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel,
        a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who
        threw
        down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie,
        the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel
        whose
        every action is imbricated in violence—the archetypal
        Fanatical Terrorist.

          Revolution"
